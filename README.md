# foafiaf-sidebar
Sidebar navigation shell for FOAFIAF visualization page



Based on web app code at http://ifis.iowafloodcenter.org/ifis/app/ 

## Todos

- shell css working properly cross platform cross browser (seems to work cross browser on Win10, not iOS, MacOS, Android)

- list item <span> content show up as infor box at lower part of slide out on reference app - not working
- np_sidepanel are toggled in settings INFO PANELS - but not showing up correctly per ref app
- When page loads, menu panel slide out background display and should not
- Menu panel selectors toggle fine - want to pass values / changes into framed content so independent fram pages can act accordingly
- example of desired pop up / property sheet shone at Settings / Options / Feedback - wish to implement front end JS for sending email (ideas)
- want to use similar / same sheet for many popups in interior pages

- Want html/css/js to be in single page and act as SPA - the page is just the shell which frames in other pages and allows toggle selection - no other functionality 
- HTML page should be able to be download loaded and run locally - obviously image assets will be loaded remote - will likely host them on s3
- Once functionality of shell is complete, want to incorporate / customize minimal css and js separate from reference app

-- would like to implement Settings / Options / Snapshot
-- would like to use mobile version ala http://ifis.iowafloodcenter.org/ifis/mobile/
